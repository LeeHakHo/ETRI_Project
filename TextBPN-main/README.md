![](https://github.com/GXYM/TextBPN/blob/main/vis/1.png)  

## 1.Prerequisites 
  python 3.9;  
  PyTorch 1.7.0;   
  Numpy >=1.2.0   
  CUDA 11.1;  
  GCC >=10.0;  
  *opencv-python < 4.5.0*  
  NVIDIA GPU(with 11G or larger GPU memory for inference); 
  
## 2.Arguments
```
Unfortunately it doesn't support mgpu. I recommend going to option.py and config.py with the arguments you want and editing them yourself at the same time.

config.CRAFT = Whether to use CRAFT

config.gpu = GPU to use

config.batch_size = batch_size

config.max_epoch = max_epoch

config.lr = learning rate

config.output_dir = output path to save result

config.max_annotation = maximum number of polygons that can appear in one image

config.num_points = maximum number of points used in a polygon

option.save_dir = path to checkpoint model

option.vis_dir = path to save visualization result

option.save_freq = How many epochs to save the model

option.checkepoch = epoch num to checkpoint model

```  

## 3.Train
run:  
*difying the args does not update unless the option.py directly modified, so it is recommended to modify the code script.
```
python3 train_textBPN.py
```

## 4.Demo
*difying the args does not update unless the option.py directly modified, so it is recommended to modify the code script.
run:  
```
python3 demo.py
```
